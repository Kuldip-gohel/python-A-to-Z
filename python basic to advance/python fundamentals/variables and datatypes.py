''' Variables :- 
A variable in Python is a named location used to store data in memory. You can think of a variable as a container that holds information which can be used and updated throughout a program. '''

# For example
NAME = "Kuldip" # NAME variable storing a string.
AGE = 20 # AGE variable storinf an integer.

''' Data types :-
Data Types define the kind of value a variable holds.
'''
fruit = "Apple"   #Apple is 'String' Datatype
Price = 50  #50 is 'integer' Datatype


# Let's see some example of Variables and Datatypes

# Integer variable
Age = 20
print(type(Age)) # it will show --> <class 'int'>

# Float variable
Temperature = 30.4
print(type(Temperature)) # <class 'float'>

# String variable
Name = "Kuldip"
print("Type of Name variable is str -->",Name)

# Boolean variable
is_student = True
print(type(is_student))
